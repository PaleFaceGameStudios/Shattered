{"name":"Shattered","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to the Shattered Project Page.\r\nHere you can download the project and explore how far we have gone with the development of our game.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2015, Rasmus Leifsgård (@Leifsgard), and Marcus Nilsson (@Hol1x) started the development of \"Shattered\".\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving any problems with the project? Have you found any bugs or got some tips? Feel free to contact leifsgard@outlook.com and we’ll try to sort it out! :) \r\nThanks!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
